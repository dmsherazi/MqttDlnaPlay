# MqttDlnaPLay

Small dlna player that can be controlled through mqtt in
order to play media to a media renderer (ex: smart TV).

It is currently tied to file naming as generated by
[JavaPVR](https://github.com/mhdawson/JavaPVR) and the
feature to automatically mark/hide media that you have
already watched.  This allows it to automatically
figure out the next episode in a series that was
recorded but has not yet been watched and play that
for you.

I current use it with [AlexaMqttBridge]
(https://github.com/mhdawson/AlexaMqttBridge) so
that we can simply say:

```
Alexa ask Michael to play XXXX
```

were XXXX is the name of a recorded TV series and
it will play the next available episode that
we have not yet watched.

I then also support the regular stop/start/seek
type commands so that you can control the media
being played once it is started.
